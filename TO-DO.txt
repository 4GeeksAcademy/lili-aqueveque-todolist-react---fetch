Create a TODO list application that allows users to add and delete tasks.


Instructions:
- You app needs to look like this.
- The tasks are added when the user press enter on the keyboard, or you can have your own button.
- The delete icon shows only when the task is hovered.
- The user can add as many tasks as he/she wants.
- When there are no tasks the list should say "No tasks, add a task"
- There is no way to update a task, the user will have to delete and create again.


Strategy:
- What components will you create? Draw the project on white paper and identify components.
        1 component called TodoList
- Where are the tasks going to be stored in your component?
        They are stored in an empty array?
        And they come from a state variable called todoInput
- Read about controlled components inputs in react.js, you will need to understand the concept.

Pseudocode:
✔ Create a component called TodoList: 

✔  Initialize state variables:
✔    - todoInput (to store the user input for new todos, initially empty)
✔    - todos (an array to store the list of todos, initially empty)

✔  Create an input field where users can type new todos.
✔  When the input field value changes:
✔    - Update the todoInput state variable with the new value.

✔ When a key is pressed in the input field:
✔    - If the pressed key is Enter:
✔      - Prevent the default behavior --> if not, it leads to a page reload
✔      - If the todoInput is not empty:
✔        - Add the todoInput to the todos array.
✔        - Clear the todoInput for the next input.

✔  When a delete icon is pressed the list item:
✔      - Gets removed

✔  Display the current todos as a list.
✔  For each todo in the todos array:
✔    - Display the todo as a list item.

End component TodoList.

Fetch:
- Make your to-do list sync with the backend API every time a task is added or deleted.
- Add a clean all tasks button that will delete the entire list from the server and update the empty list on the front-end.

Hint:
fetch('https://playground.4geeks.com/apis/fake/todos/user/alesanchezr', {
      method: "PUT",
      body: JSON.stringify(todos),
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
    })
    .then(resp => {
        console.log(resp.ok); // will be true if the response is successfull
        console.log(resp.status); // the status code = 200 or code = 400 etc.
        console.log(resp.text()); // will try return the exact result as string
        return resp.json(); // (returns promise) will try to parse the result as json as return a promise that you can .then for results
    })
    .then(data => {
        //here is where your code should start after the fetch finishes
        console.log(data); //this will print on the console the exact object received from the server
    })
    .catch(error => {
        //error handling
        console.log(error);
    });
